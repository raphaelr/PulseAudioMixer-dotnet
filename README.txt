This is an old toy project I created a couple of years ago to control a local PulseAudio server (aka running on Windows (maybe Mono, never tried it)), which could in turn control an audio sink over the network (don't ask. I needed it back then.)

I've done my best to get the same look and feel as the native Windows module mixer.
